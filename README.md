![](readme_images/logo.png =1000x1000)

 a MacOS desktop app that annotates rectabgle regions where you click-and-drag-ed and writes the coordinates into a text file per row. This is a demo annotation tool application I used to create a trainning data set for some supervised learning project I have worked for.

## Abstruct

    Using Xcode with Swift4, 
    this application enables users to annotate the coordinates of rectangular sections.
    that users wish to label.

- [ ]   better UI design 
- [ ]   implement a "goBack" button and its functions that users will be able to work on already saved images
- [ ]   implement some sort of a bar-looking display one's current progress over the total number of images
- [ ]   implement a table view to display the coordinates of rectangular selections a user drew
- [ ]   add capability to write out xml, json and more...
